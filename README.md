Word embeddings 

A word embedding algorithm was used to compare text on the World CNN and World BBC’s live television programs using Gensim’s word to vector algorithm. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) captured the variance in our word vector dataset. We can then use the transformed word vectors to find and plot similar words on a scatterplot based on the variance between the word vectors. 

In addition, we built two basic artificial neural networks (binary classification) classifying whether a customer would return for another loan or not based on their demographics, job, and relationship history. 

Here is a quick analysis showing the cosine simialrity between CNN anf FOX news.
